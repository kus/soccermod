## Installation
### 1. Download the required plugins
To run Soccer Mod on your server you need the following plugins:

Click the links and select the correct download for your server (Linux or Windows). Save the zip files in the same location, for example on your desktop.

### 2. Extract the zip files
Right click on each zip file and select "Extract Here". After extracting the 3 zip files you should have 5 folders on your desktop:
- addons
- cfg
- maps
- materials
- models

### 3. Copy or upload the folders
Copy or upload the folders to your server's "csgo" folder, for example:
- D:\Servers\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo (local server)
- /home/csgo (hosted server)

Soccer Mod is now fully installed and will be loaded automatically when the server is restarted.
